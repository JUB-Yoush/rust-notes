# Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts
- In this chapter we will learn:
    - concepts that appear in almost every programming language, and how they work in rust.
        - variables 
        - basic types 
        - functions 
        - comments
        - control flow

## Keywords
 - Like most languages, rust has a set of keywords that are reserved for use by the language only. You **cannot use keywords as the names of functions or variables**

## Variables and Mutability
- In rust, variables are **immutable** by default.
- This is the languages way of encouraging you to take advantage of the safety and easy concurrency that Rust offers.
- Rust generally encourages you to favor immutability.
- Immutable values can't be changed after making them
- consider the following code:
```Rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}
```
- we never used the mut keyword on x, so when we go to compile this code
```
$ cargo run
   Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
 --> src/main.rs:4:5

2 |     let x = 5;
  |         -
  |         |
  |         first assignment to `x`
  |         help: consider making this binding mutable: `mut x`
3 |     println!("The value of x is: {x}");
4 |     x = 6;
  |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable

```
- the compiler in rust is super cool and friendly and wants to make sure you aren't making your computer explode.

- ``cannot assign twice to immutable variable x`` means you're re-assigning a immutable variable
- if your variable is expected to never change and *does*, it can lead to very hard to track errors.
- Rust won't let you write unsafe code
