# Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game
- learn the language hand's on through making a guessing game
- learn about:
  - let
  - match
  - methods
  - associated functions
  - external crates
  - and more!

- we'll make a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game.
  - the game will generate a secret number between 1 and 100
  - it will then prompt the player to guess what the number is
  - the program will tell the user if the guess is too low, too high, or just right
  - if the guess is correct, the game ends, otherwise it loops

## Processing a guess

```Rust
use std::io; // loads the input output library into the program, part of the Prelude, the default set of libraries for Rust programs

fn main() { // opens the main function
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess."); //prints for asking for number

    let mut guess = String::new(); 
    /* creates a mutable variable named guess. guess gets bound to a new string 
    (String::new() is a function that returns one).
    rust variables are immutable by default, so you need to specify if they'll be changing
    the :: syntax indicates that the new is an associated function 
    (a function thatâ€™s implemented on a type)
    */

    io::stdin() //use the io library to call stdin() for standard input reading 
        .read_line(&mut guess) 
        /* call the readline method on the standard input handle 
        (to read the line of user input)
        the & before the value indicated that this argument is a reference, 
        which gives you a way to make shallow copies of your value (I think)
        */
                .expect("Failed to read line"); 
        /*
        this entire function could've been written as
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
        but we break up the methods for readability
        this final part of the line checks if the result value of the enum was successful or not (could the io line read the user input)
        make sure to always handle when your enums return err and not ok
        */

    println!("You guessed: {guess}"); // {} to put vars in output,
    /* can also be added to the end
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;

    println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
    */

}
```

## Testing what you've made
- you can run ``cargo run`` to compile your guessing game and try it out so far

Example output:
```
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 6.44s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
Please input your guess.
6
You guessed: 6
```

## Generating the number to guess
- rust doesn't include a rng generator in it's standard library
- we'll need to import a rng crate (package)

### Using crates to get more functionality
- a crate is a collection of rust source code files
- we've been building a **binary** crate (something that will be built into binary)
- The ``rand`` crate we'll be using to make rng is a **library** crate
