# Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game
- learn the language hand's on through making a guessing game
- learn about:
  - let
  - match
  - methods
  - associated functions
  - external crates
  - and more!

- we'll make a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game.
  - the game will generate a secret number between 1 and 100
  - it will then prompt the player to guess what the number is
  - the program will tell the user if the guess is too low, too high, or just right
  - if the guess is correct, the game ends, otherwise it loops

## Processing a guess

```Rust
use std::io; // loads the input output library into the program, part of the Prelude, the default set of libraries for Rust programs

fn main() { // opens the main function
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess."); //prints for asking for number

    let mut guess = String::new(); 
    /* creates a mutable variable named guess. guess gets bound to a new string 
    (String::new() is a function that returns one).
    rust variables are immutable by default, so you need to specify if they'll be changing
    the :: syntax indicates that the new is an associated function 
    (a function thatâ€™s implemented on a type)
    */

    io::stdin() //use the io library to call stdin() for standard input reading 
        .read_line(&mut guess) 
        /* call the readline method on the standard input handle 
        (to read the line of user input)
        the & before the value indicated that this argument is a reference, 
        which gives you a way to make shallow copies of your value (I think)
        */
                .expect("Failed to read line"); 
        /*
        this entire function could've been written as
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");
        but we break up the methods for readability
        this final part of the line checks if the result value of the enum was successful or not (could the io line read the user input)
        make sure to always handle when your enums return err and not ok
        */

    println!("You guessed: {guess}"); // {} to put vars in output,
    /* can also be added to the end
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;

    println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
    */

}
```

## Testing what you've made
- you can run ``cargo run`` to compile your guessing game and try it out so far

Example output:
```
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 6.44s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
Please input your guess.
6
You guessed: 6
```

## Generating the number to guess
- rust doesn't include a rng generator in it's standard library
- we'll need to import a rng crate (package)

### Using crates to get more functionality
- a crate is a collection of rust source code files
- we've been building a **binary** crate (something that will be built into binary)
- The ``rand`` crate we'll be using to make rng is a **library** crate, which are intended to be ran in other binary crates and can't be ran on their own.
- in order to use ``rand``, we'll need to add it to our dependencies in our cargo.toml file. 
- This let's cargo know we'll need this file for our binary to work properly
- add a line referencing it under ``[dependencies]``
```
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```
- The specifier ``0.8.5`` is actually shorthand for ``^0.8.5``, which means any version that is at least ``0.8.5`` but below ``0.9.0``
- running ``cargo build`` will give us all the files we need to use ``rand``
- When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of everything that dependency needs from the registry, which is a copy of data from Crates.io. Crates.io is where people in the Rust ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.
- your cargo.lock file will ensure that cargo will retrieve versions of the crates that work with your code, based on version number semantics
- your version will remain at ``0.8.5`` until you upgrade it yourself
- using the ``cargo update`` command will automatically update all the crates your project uses to a version that doesn't break your project.

### Generating the random number
update your code:
```Rust
use std::io;
use rand::Rng; // import the rand crate and the Rng Trait. Traits must be in scope for use to use those methods

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    /*
    using the rand::thread_rng() 
    function gives us a particular random number generator we're going to use.
    The gen_range() method defined by the Rng Trait takes a range expression and makes a number in it's range. (start..=end)
    */
    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}"); //displays secret number

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
}
```

### Comparing guess to random number
  update code
  ```Rust
use rand::Rng;
use std::cmp::Ordering; // add the ordering type from the standard library into the file
use std::io;

fn main() {
    // --snip--

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    /*
    the cmp method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be compared.
    we're comparing guess to secret number (using & to make it a reference)
    we use the match statment to decide what to do based on every comparison result
    a match expression is made up of arms, 
    an arm consists of a pattern to match against and the code that should run if the pattern is matched.
    */
    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
}
  ```
  try to compile your code and you'll run into an **error**

error: could not compile `guessing_game` due to previous error
```

- The code of the error states that there are mismatched types.
- Rust has a strict type system, but also is able to make assumptions about what types values should be
- we don't need to tell it that ``let mut guess = String::new();`` should be a string because it can infer that from the function.
- but the guess is simply "a number between 1-100" 
- and there are a few datatypes that could fill that role
- rust defaults to a ``i32``, which is a signed 32-bit integer
- we want to convert the string the io function reads in to a number that can be compared

add this line to the ``main`` function body
```Rust
    // --snip--

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    /*
    we re-define guess using shadowing 
    we run the functions .trim().parse() on guess to eliminate any whitespace at the beginning or end,
    and the parse function coverts it to the type we specify (u32)
    because we explicitly define the guess type and compare it to secret number, the rust compiler will know to make secret number match the guess type (u32)

    the parse method can only work on strings that can be converted to numbers and can fail quite easily, it's important to account for the result type 
    */
    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!"); //this one

    println!("You guessed: {guess}");

    match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
        Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
        Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
        Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
    }
```
running the program works now

```
$ cargo run
   Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s
     Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
Guess the number!
The secret number is: 58
Please input your guess.
  76
You guessed: 76
Too big!
```
### Allowing multiple guesses with looping
- the ``loop`` keyword makes your code loop forever.
- use the ``break`` keyword inside to escape this loop

```Rust
    // --snip--

    println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");

    loop {
        println!("Please input your guess.");

        // --snip--

        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => {
                println!("You win!");
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- make sure to indent the lines for readability
- the guess now loops forever, and breaks when the guess matches secret number

### Handling Invalid input
- rn the game crashes when the user enters a wrong number
- we can modify this to make the game continue looping instead
```Rust
        // --snip--

        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
        /*
        we switch from a expect call to a match call
        and have different results for ok and err
        if ok, put the value you converted into guess
        if Err, continue the loop
        the (_) is a catchall value, we're saying we want to match any incorrect input no matter what it looks like
        */
        let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
            Ok(num) => num,
            Err(_) => continue,
        };

        println!("You guessed: {guess}");

        // --snip--

```
## FINAL CODE

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);

        let mut guess = String::new();
