# Rust 

note to self, use ``cargo new --vcs=none my-new-project`` to prevent each new rust project from having it's *own* git repo. 

using the version of the book with the quizzes: https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html

- rust is about empowerment
- works good at low level operations, but expressive and ergonomic enough to make stuff you'd not want to make in C.

## Who is Rust For

- Teams of devs who want to collab, the compiler is very strict and good at catching bugs and reduces the time you'd spend
